# Calculator-OdinProject

This Calculator can perform basic math operations.

You can either click on the buttons or use your keyboard.
"Delete" key  will perform Clear while Backscpace removes last character if you made a mistake ;)
You can use either "." or "," for floating point numbers.
It has some basic scaling for small screens applied, but nothing fancy really.

This project was done during completion of The Odin Project - a great free course <3
If you find any bugs or mistakes please don't hesitate to contact me - I'm still learning so it's not gonna be perfect.
